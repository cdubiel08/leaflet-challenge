# Leaflet Homework - Visualizing Data with Leaflet

## Background
United States Geological Survey data to visualize earthquake data. 

### Level 1: Basic Visualization


1. **Retrieve data set**

     Selected data of the last 7 days of 4.5 or greater magnitudes at https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/feed/v1.0/summary/4.5_week.geojson

   
2. **Import & Visualize the Data**

   Created a map using Leaflet that plots all of the earthquakes of data based on longitude and latitude.

   * Data markers reflect the magnitude of the earthquake by their size and and depth of the earth quake by color.

   * Includes popups that provide additional information about the earthquake when a marker is clicked.

   * Created a legend that will provide context for map data.
